Professional Blog using django
In this project i have used django as the backend and Bootsrap5 as the front-end.By the name Blog the project seems to be easy but coding Blog post web using django is not easy as just using Wordpress. I have integrated many important features like commenting system,Login and register features using forms validation security and django authentications and authorization in this project.With the support of django admin i built very attractive adminsite where the admin can control over the whole things. Social media integration was another important feature in my project, still developing this and adding more .
